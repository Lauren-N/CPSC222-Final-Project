# CPSC222-Final-Project

This program details exploratory data analysis, visualization and machine learniing of a dataset containing 70 days
of Wordle data. Wordle is an online game that has a new 5 letter word to guess every day and you are given 6 chances. 
My project is organized in a Jupyter Notebook that implements functions to use from a utils.py file inside this repo. 

To run this program:
1. clone repo into your own machine
2. open in some type of editor, this code was created on Visual Studio Code
  so that might be the best environment to run on. 
3. the main file to run is called "my_project.ipynb" and to run just click the run all button
  on the top menu bar
